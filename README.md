An assignment project for the web programming 1 course in the svu
Designing a website for streaming movies similar to the website (Egybest).
In the front page of the website (HOME.aspx) the available movies are shown as well as a search bar feature that allows the user to search for a movie, based on its name or on the name of a member of the cast(actors), another feature has been added to the search bar which is a search filter feature, which allows you to search for a movie based on its year of production,  spoken language, country, and genre.
When choosing a movie and clicking on its thumbnail or name, the website takes the user to another page (details.aspx) and  displays the following information about the chosen movie: the story of the movie, year of production, language, pictures and names of actors and cast members, as well as the poster of the movie.
When clicking on the picture or name of a certain actor/actress the website displays every movie they have participated in.
Movies can be added, altered, and deleted from a  page called (admin. aspx) and can only be accessed by logging in using a username and password through a login  page called (login.aspx).
